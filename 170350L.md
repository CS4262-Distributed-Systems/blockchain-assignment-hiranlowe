1.	Smart Contracts

    Smart contracts are programs that execute when certain predetermined conditions are met. They are stored on a blockchain. The 'chain code' smart contract in Hyperledger Fabric allows read and update data on the blockchain ledger, and finally, those made changes are verified with all parties in the blockchain network.

2.	Distributed Ledger (DLT)

    DLT is used as a system for recording transactions of assets, which ensures the transaction details are recorded in multiple places simultaneously. DLS have no central data store or administration. DLT securely stores data using cryptography and creates an immutable database.
